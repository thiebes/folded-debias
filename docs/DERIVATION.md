# Folded-normal derivation of the MSD bias and its correction

This note derives, from a folded-normal model of the fitted width, why the
diffusion coefficient is overestimated and what the correct fix is. The model
is the one the boundary diagnostic selected: `scripts/diagnose_boundary.py`
found the fitted-variance distribution strictly interior and right-skewed with
no delta-mass at the lower bound, for all three profile models — **reflection,
not clipping**.

## 1. Model

At each frame *i* the analysis fits a profile and reports a width. A fitted
width cannot be negative. Reflection at that wall means the latent width
estimate behaves as the absolute value of a Gaussian: writing the latent
estimate as `X_i`, the reported width is `|X_i|` with

    X_i ~ N(σ_i, s_i²),

where `σ_i` is the true width at frame *i* and `s_i` is the per-frame
estimation noise (a decreasing function of the per-frame CNR). The fitted
**variance** is therefore the square of a Gaussian,

    σ̂²_i = |X_i|² = X_i².

Equivalently `σ̂²_i / s_i²` is a non-central χ²₁ with non-centrality `(σ_i/s_i)²`
— continuous, strictly positive, right-skewed, exactly the shape the diagnostic
saw.

## 2. Moments

For `X ~ N(σ, s²)`, using `E[X²] = σ² + s²` and `E[X⁴] = σ⁴ + 6σ²s² + 3s⁴`:

    E[σ̂²]   = σ² + s²
    Var[σ̂²] = E[X⁴] − E[X²]² = 4σ²s² + 2s⁴ = 2s²(2σ² + s²)

**The fitted variance carries an additive upward bias equal to the estimation
noise variance `s²`.** This is the Gaussian-width analogue of the Rician
identity `Â² = M² − σ²` (Gudbjartsson–Patz 1995) and of the Wardle–Kronberg
polarization estimator.

## 3. The per-frame truncation fraction

Define the latent width signal-to-noise `α_i = σ_i / s_i`. The truncation
fraction — the mass of the latent estimator below the wall — is

    p_i = P(X_i < 0) = Φ(−α_i),     so   α_i = −Φ⁻¹(p_i).

`p_i` is a clean, dimensionless readout of `α_i`, and on real data it follows
from the per-frame CNR (via `fft-cnr`). In terms of `p`:

- relative bias of σ̂²:      `s²/σ² = 1/α²              = 1 / Φ⁻¹(p)²`
- relative variance of σ̂²:  `Var[σ̂²]/σ⁴ = 2(2α²+1)/α⁴`, with `α = −Φ⁻¹(p)`

So the *shape* of the bias and variance is fixed by `p` alone. The *scale* is
not: `p` is dimensionless, the bias `s²` has units of variance. The absolute
scale must come from the per-frame CNR through a noise model (the localization
Cramér–Rao bound, `s² ∝ σ²/CNR²` to leading order) or by calibration against
matched simulations. Both `p` and the CNR scale are needed — which is why the
weighting takes the per-frame CNR as its input, not `p` alone.

## 4. Why the bias reaches D, and why a weight alone cannot remove it

The MSD point is `MSD_i = σ̂²_i − σ̂²_0`, so

    E[MSD_i] = (σ_i² − σ_0²) + (s_i² − s_0²) = MSD_true,i + (s_i² − s_0²).

Because CNR falls frame by frame, `s_i` grows with *i*; the bias `s_i² − s_0²`
is an increasing function of time. An increasing additive offset on `MSD(t)`
tilts the fitted slope upward — `D` is overestimated, the more so at low CNR.

A reweighting of the MSD-vs-t fit **cannot** remove this. Weights change which
points dominate the slope; they cannot subtract a mean offset that is present
in every point. Down-weighting late frames trades the bias for variance but
never eliminates it. The bias must be **subtracted**, not weighted away. This
is the central result: the standard inverse-variance scheme is structurally
unable to fix the bias, however the weights are chosen.

## 5. The derived method

1. **Bias-correct each frame.** Subtract the estimation-noise variance:
   `ṽ²_i = σ̂²_i − s_i²`, so `E[ṽ²_i] = σ_i²`. Build the MSD from the corrected
   variances: `MSD_i = ṽ²_i − ṽ²_0`.
2. **Weight by inverse variance.** `w_i = 1 / (Var[σ̂²_i] + Var[σ̂²_0])` with
   `Var[σ̂²] = 2s²(2σ² + s²)`. Subtracting a (calibrated, deterministic) bias
   does not change the variance, so the weight is the ordinary inverse-variance
   weight; the bias correction is the new ingredient.

In `weighting_wall` this is the `folded_normal` scheme. It differs from
`inverse_variance` *only* by step 1, so comparing the two isolates the effect
of the bias correction.

## 6. POC implementation

The per-frame noise variance `s_i²` is obtained by calibration: a Monte Carlo
CNR sweep gives `E[σ̂²] − σ²_true` as a function of CNR — the `var_bias(CNR)`
model in `TruncationModel`. The folded-normal model is what licenses this:
it tells us the bias is *additive*, *positive*, and a function of the per-frame
CNR, so a one-dimensional `var_bias(CNR)` calibration is the right object to
build. Calibration and evaluation use independent random seeds. On real data
the same calibration is done against simulations matched to the measurement
(Koay-style simulation-based debiasing).

## 7. Open points

- The POC calibrates `s²(CNR)`; the analytic `s² ∝ σ²/CNR²` (localization CRLB)
  should be checked against the calibration as a model test.
- Subdiffusive transport (`MSD ∝ t^α`, α < 1) — confirm the correction
  de-biases α as well as D.
- Voigt and generalized-Gaussian models showed a minor (~5%) clipping pile-up
  at CNR ≈ 1; a small censored term may be needed there, on top of the
  folded-normal correction, for the deepest-noise frames.
