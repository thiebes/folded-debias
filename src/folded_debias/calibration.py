"""Single-frame calibration cells and the 2-D per-frame calibration -- experimental.

The recommended D-free calibration is :func:`folded_debias.calibrate_d_free`,
a 1-D lookup that runs the CNR-sweep calibration at ``D = 0``. It
captures the bias at ``sigma^2 = sigma_0^2``, which is the relevant region
for the low-D regime where the truncation bias bites (sigma^2(t) barely
changes across the measurement when D is small); see
``experiments/dfree-calibration/validate_d_zero.py`` for its validation.

:func:`calibrate_cells` supplies the single-frame Monte Carlo cells that
:func:`folded_debias.calibrate_fisher` smooths. The 2-D calibration
(:func:`calibrate_cnr_sigma2`) is a more general construction kept
for future work: it generates **single-frame** noisy profiles on a
(CNR, variance) grid, so the lookup is keyed on both the per-frame CNR and
the observed width. The intended use is **heterogeneous transport** where
the per-realisation sigma^2 spread is large enough that the 1-D-at-sigma_0^2
approximation breaks down.

**Status: experimental.** In the low-CNR cells (CNR < 1), the Monte Carlo
noise per cell dominates the per-cell bias estimate and the resulting lookup
is too noisy to use without substantial additional sample budget (n_runs
>~ 5000 per cell, plus post-hoc smoothing). The fixed-point inversion in
:meth:`TruncationModel.var_bias` compensates for the lookup-at-biased-sigma^2
issue but cannot rescue the underlying MC noise.

    deviation ``amplitude / cnr`` to a clean profile of peak ``amplitude`` --
    the idealised additive-noise regime (signal-independent), kept for the

    ``poisson`` is the realistic detector model following the photon-transfer

    ``gain * Poisson((clean_counts + background) / gain) + Normal(0, read_noise)``
    -- shot noise that rides on the signal (slope ``gain``) plus a constant

    ``gain = 1, read_noise = 0`` is pure photon counting (TCSPC/APD); ``gain > 1``
    is an excess-noise/conversion factor; a large ``read_noise`` is
    read-noise-dominated (camera-like). ``gain`` and ``read_noise`` are detector
    constants (estimate them once from fft-cnr's photon-transfer fit on a bright,
    high-dynamic-range frame). The baseline standard deviation is
    ``sqrt(gain * background + read_noise^2)``, so a requested per-frame ``cnr``
    fixes the peak counts at ``cnr * baseline_noise`` (CNR = peak / baseline
    noise). The baseline is estimated from the outer pixels and subtracted

    """Build the joint (CNR, sigma^2) calibration of the fit bias.

    The lookup has two scalar parameter axes -- per-frame CNR and the true
    fitted variance sigma^2 -- producing a surface ``bias(CNR, sigma^2)``.
    The "2D" refers to those two parameter axes (not anything spatial or
    temporal); the calibration's Monte Carlo is static, with the data the
    lookup will be applied to remaining 1-D spatial profiles measured over
    time.

    The lookup needs a key for the unknown true sigma^2. Keying each frame on
    its own fitted sigma_hat^2 under-corrects when sigma^2 grows several-fold
    over the measurement; see :meth:`TruncationModel.var_bias` ("Choice of
    key") before applying this calibration to fast-spreading data.

    Cells are evaluated in parallel via :class:`ProcessPoolExecutor`. Each
    cell's RNG is seeded from a :class:`numpy.random.SeedSequence` spawn so
    the calibration is reproducible irrespective of completion order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : profile model instance (see :mod:`folded_debias.models`).
        Defaults to :class:`~folded_debias.models.GaussianModel`. The
        model's name is recorded; its class and ``model_kwargs`` are used to
        reconstruct the model inside worker processes.
    pixel_x : the spatial axis on which the fit will run. Must match the
        application's pixel grid for the calibration to apply. Defaults to
        the standard :class:`Experiment` grid.
    variance_grid : the true sigma^2 values to span. Mutually exclusive with
        ``sigma_grid``. Defaults to ``np.linspace(0.6, 3.5, 12)`` (in units
        consistent with ``pixel_x``).
    sigma_grid : alternative way to specify the variance axis -- linear-in-
        sigma spacing, which gives denser sampling at small sigma^2 (where
        the bias gradient is largest near the wall at zero). Internally
        converted to ``variance_grid = sigma_grid ** 2``. Pass either this
        or ``variance_grid``, not both.
    cnr_grid : the per-frame CNR values to span. Defaults to log-spaced
        ``np.logspace(np.log10(0.15), np.log10(120), 22)``.
    amplitude : the noise-free peak amplitude. Only its ratio to noise (=
        CNR) affects the bias, so the value is conventional; left at 1.0.
    n_runs : Monte-Carlo runs per grid cell.
    seed : root random seed; each cell gets an independent stream.
    n_workers : number of worker processes. Defaults to ``os.cpu_count() - 1``.
        Set to 1 to run serially.
    model_kwargs : kwargs to reconstruct the model in every cell, serial or
        parallel (e.g. ``{"gamma": 0.01}`` for :class:`VoigtModel`,
        ``{"shape": 1.5}`` for :class:`GeneralizedGaussianModel`). Each cell
        re-instantiates the model from its name and these kwargs, so the
        passed instance's own settings (shape exponent, ``gamma``,
        ``max_var``) are lost unless they are repeated here.
    filter_threshold : per-cell, when computing the mean bias, discard any
        individual fit whose sigma_hat^2 exceeds this threshold. These are
        broken fits pegged at the fit's upper bound; their contribution to
        the mean pollutes the bias estimate at low-CNR cells. Defaults to
        ``5 * variance_grid.max()``, which catches anything near var_max
        without touching legitimate fits inside the calibration's grid.
        rel_variance is computed without the filter so broken cells
        correctly report high spread (downstream slope fit then
        downweights frames at those cells).
    verbose : print per-completion progress every ~10% of cells.
