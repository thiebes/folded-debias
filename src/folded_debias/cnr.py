"""Per-frame CNR estimation -- the input the whole weighting scheme rests on.

For Monte Carlo validation the per-frame CNR is known exactly (it is set by the
simulation; see :func:`folded_debias.simulate.cnr_per_frame`).  For *real*
measurements it must be estimated from each spatial profile, with no repeated
frames and no separate background region available.  That is exactly what the
``fft-cnr`` package does: it separates slowly varying signal from rapid noise
in the spatial frequency domain and returns a CNR estimate per 1-D profile.

This module wraps ``fft-cnr`` behind a single function and degrades gracefully
when the package is not installed, so the simulation-only POC has no hard
dependency on it.

The calibration is keyed on the exact CNR, and the estimate is not an unbiased
stand-in for it near the floor: it reads slightly low at CNR 1 to 2 and about
twice the exact value below CNR 0.5, and its error is correlated with the
frame's width error. Keying the correction on the per-frame estimate is
therefore reliable only where every fitted frame stays well above the floor
(CNR_0 about 34 at D = 0.02 sigma_0^2/tau in the reference geometry). See
``experiments/wse2-strobescat/README.md`` for the domain and its evidence.
Use fft-cnr 0.3.3 or later (the first PyPI release with commit 69cd361), which
refuses degenerate generalized-Gaussian fits below CNR 1 instead of reporting
runaway CNRs.

    ----------
    profiles : array, shape (n_frames, n_pixels)
        Stack of 1-D spatial profiles, one per time point.
    fit_model : str
        The ``fft-cnr`` amplitude estimator. Defaults to
        ``"generalized_gaussian"`` because this project's primary profiles are
        Voigt and generalized-Gaussian, and the amplitude (hence CNR) must be
        estimated without shape bias. A fixed Gaussian template -- or fft-cnr's
        default peak method -- is accurate on a true Gaussian but biased on the
        heavy-tailed / flat-topped shapes that bracket Voigt and
        generalized-Gaussian: the fft-cnr shape-sensitivity study (case 3) puts
        a Gaussian fit 5-17 % off across that kurtosis range while the
        generalized-Gaussian fit stays within ~1 %, with the Gaussian falling
        out as the p=2 special case. Because the truncation bias scales as
        ~A/CNR^2, a biased CNR feeds straight into a biased correction, so the
        shape-robust estimator matters here. The generalized-Gaussian fit
        returns a finite confidence interval (it falls back to the peak method
        if the fit fails), so there is no missing-CI pathology.
