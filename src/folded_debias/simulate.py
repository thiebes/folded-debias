"""Generation of synthetic 1-D profile sequences for Monte Carlo validation.

A population of excited states is modelled as a 1-D Gaussian that broadens by
Fickian diffusion and decays by a single exponential lifetime.  White noise is
added at the level of the raw spatial profile -- the only level at which it can
be added correctly, because the fitting hierarchy reshapes the error
distribution downstream (Thiebes & Grumstrup, JCP 2024).

    The variance grows as a power law, ``sigma^2(t) = sigma0^2 + 2 D t^alpha``,
    rather than the Fickian ``alpha = 1``. The exponent alpha is the disorder
    signature the field reads from the MSD curve: ``alpha < 1`` is subdiffusive
    (energetic disorder / trapping, as in disordered nanocrystal solids),
    ``alpha > 1`` superdiffusive. ``alpha = 1`` reproduces :class:`Experiment`
    exactly, which is the consistency check the validation leans on.

    Only the two truth properties change; the geometry (``x``, ``times``), the
    single-exponential decay (``amplitude``), and the CNR bookkeeping are
    inherited unchanged, so the whole Monte Carlo / fit / weighting pipeline
    runs on this bed with no other change. The truncation bias lifts the
    low-CNR late frames more than the high-CNR early ones, which tilts the MSD
    curve toward a steeper apparent exponent -- so the bias contaminates alpha,
    not only D, and this bed is how the correction's recovery of alpha is
    scored.

    ``D`` carries units of ``sigma0^2 / tau^alpha`` here (so ``2 D t^alpha`` is
    a variance for ``t`` in units of ``tau``); it coincides with the Fickian
    ``sigma0^2 / tau`` only at ``alpha = 1``. To compare exponents at a matched
    diffusion length over the window, choose ``D`` per alpha to fix the
    end-point MSD ``2 D t_max^alpha`` (see ``scripts/subdiffusive_alpha.py``).

    """A measurement whose population decays with a sum of exponentials.

    Real photoluminescence rarely decays as a single exponential: a fast
    surface/trap channel plus a slow bulk channel give a bi-exponential, and a
    distribution of trap depths gives a stretched-exponential-like curve. The
    peak amplitude here is a normalised sum of exponentials,

        amplitude(t) = amplitude0 * sum_i f_i exp(-t/tau_i) / sum_i f_i,

    so amplitude(0) = amplitude0 and CNR_0 keeps its meaning. The diffusion law
    is the inherited Fickian one; only the decay (hence the per-frame CNR
    trajectory) changes.

    The point of this bed is that the folded-normal correction keys on the
    *per-frame CNR*, not on the decay law: the per-frame residual bias is the
    same function of per-frame CNR whichever decay produced it, so multi-
    exponential decay does not invalidate the correction. It does change *which*
    per-frame CNR appears at *which* frame, so any result indexed by the initial
    CNR_0 (rather than the per-frame CNR) is decay-law-specific.
