# boundary-diagnostic

## Purpose

Decide which boundary model the width fit obeys at the wall at zero: does the
fitted variance **clip** (Tobit-style pile-up at the bound) or **reflect** (fold
into a right-skewed tail)? This decision selects the correction route.

## Contents

- `diagnose_boundary.py [profile_model]` -- one run per profile model; reports
  the fitted-variance distribution shape vs CNR.

## Data

None. Fully synthetic.

## Run

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/boundary-diagnostic/diagnose_boundary.py
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/boundary-diagnostic/diagnose_boundary.py voigt
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/boundary-diagnostic/diagnose_boundary.py generalized_gaussian:1.5
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/boundary-diagnostic/diagnose_boundary.py generalized_gaussian:4
```

## Key result + figure

The fit **reflects** rather than clips, so the **folded-normal** route applies
(not Tobit/clipping). Voigt and the generalized-Gaussian p = 1.5 show a minor
wall pile-up (0.05 to 0.06 of fits) only at CNR 1; the script's overall verdict
line reads that single CNR 1 row, so it prints "CLIPPING" for them although
every row from CNR 1.5 up is reflection-like. The flat-topped p = 4 shows no
pile-up; its mean fitted variance is slightly low at CNR 1 (0.98 sigma_0^2).
