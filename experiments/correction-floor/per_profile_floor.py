"""Per-profile floor of the folded-normal correction.

The cleanest test of where the correction works: isolated single profiles
at chosen per-profile CNR, with no diffusion, no decay, no frame indexing.
For each test CNR:

1. Take the dense D-free calibration of var_bias(CNR) (100 log-spaced CNR_0 in
   [2,100], 5000 runs/cell, the same for every shape) from
   ``dfree-calibration/dense_calibration_and_test.py``, which builds it once
   per shape and caches it.
2. Simulate isolated noisy profiles at sigma^2 = sigma_0^2 and the chosen
   per-profile CNR. Many of them (``N_RUNS_TEST`` per cell). Fit each.
3. Apply the calibration's var_bias(CNR_test) to get the corrected
   per-profile variance. Measure the residual mean
   E[sigma_tilde^2] - sigma^2_true. Its SE combines the test cell's Monte Carlo
   error with the lookup's own error at that CNR (``var_bias_se``): the
   subtracted value is itself an estimate, and leaving its error out flags
   calibration noise as a failure of the correction.
4. The floor: walking down from high CNR, the deepest CNR reached while every
   cell's residual is shown to be within a tolerance (|residual| + 2 combined
   SE <= tolerance). The test is one of equivalence because a cell whose error
   is large is not evidence that the correction works there; below CNR 1 the
   lookup's own error alone is 0.1 to 0.4 sigma_0^2. The floor therefore also
   depends on the calibration budget.

The tolerance is set by an application, not fixed in sigma_0^2: a residual
matters in proportion to the MSD it sits on. The floor is reported for
tolerances of 0.1 and 0.3 of the end-point MSD 2 D t_max of the default
experiment (t_max = 3 tau) at D = 0.005, 0.02, 0.1 sigma_0^2/tau, and for the
earlier fixed 0.01 sigma_0^2 for comparison. At D = 0.005 the end-point MSD is
0.03 sigma_0^2, so a fixed 0.01 sigma_0^2 is a third of the whole signal.

If the per-profile correction holds at CNR_test, the per-frame correction
in any application (a diffusion experiment, real data, whatever) holds at
that CNR -- because the correction operates per profile. The diffusion
experiment's slope fit then inherits the per-frame unbiasedness as a
linear consequence.

Seeds are offset by 10^6 per shape, so the four shapes see independent noise.
All variances and standard errors in sigma_0^2.

Usage::

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/correction-floor/per_profile_floor.py [MODEL]

The script runs its own process pool (all cores but one), so
WIDTH_DEBIAS_WORKERS has no effect on it.

MODEL is ``gaussian``, ``voigt``, ``generalized_gaussian:1.5`` or
``generalized_gaussian:4``. ``--rescore REPORT ...`` recomputes the floor lines
of written reports from their table rows. The report goes to repo-root
``output/correction-floor/per_profile_floor_<model>.txt``.
