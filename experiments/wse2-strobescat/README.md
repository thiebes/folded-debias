# wse2-strobescat

## Purpose

Real-data truncation-bias diagnostics on Enrique Arévalo Rodríguez's stroboSCAT
diffusion scans (bulk WSe2 and MoS2/MoSe2 alloys). Reduce the scans through
Enrique's own pipeline, apply the project's folded-normal correction, and
establish what the correction does on real measurements.

## Key findings

- **De-parity is mandatory.** Every measurement is a merge of two interleaved
  delay sweeps (a coarse and a fine sweep) with *different* sigma^2(0); a single
  global baseline injects a spurious slope. Each sweep must be re-zeroed to its
  own t0 before fitting D. A global offset is slope-invariant; only this
  per-sweep re-zeroing legitimately changes D.
- **The two sweeps often disagree** (the coarse sweep diffuses; the fine sweep is
  flat or anti-diffuses), so some "diffusion" in naive global-baseline fits is a
  batch-offset artifact. WSe2 `Power_var/250224/0.020` and
  `mixed_tmdc/50_50/250702` are degenerate (negative D) under per-sweep
  re-zeroing and are not used; other WSe2 power dates are clean (both sweeps
  agree).
- **What the correction does on real data (not a validation).** The
  corrected/naive D ratio is about 1.00 for high-CNR measurements and 0.95 to
  0.99 where the fit reaches per-frame CNR of about 1.4 to 2.5
  (`diagnostics/index.md`). A ratio below 1 that grows as CNR falls follows from
  the construction (the subtracted bias is positive and increases as CNR falls),
  so it does not show that the corrected D is closer to the true D. No
  independent reference D exists for these scans yet, and no SE is computed for
  the real-data ratios. `realdata_enrique_pipeline.py` applies this repo's
  bounded-Gaussian calibration to widths from Enrique's own fit, a different
  estimator, so its corrected values are not a valid correction of those widths.
- **The bias magnitude is established in simulation only.** The correction
  debiases the *mean* (and hence D, a mean-trend slope), not every individual
  near-floor frame. The simulated recovery demo shows the true width recovered
  (the reference is known there). Whether the corrected real-data D is closer to
  the true D is untested; the planned check is a leave-one-out scan merge (the
  merge of the other scans of a measurement as a higher-CNR reference for each
  single scan).

## The CNR key on real data: estimated, not exact

The calibration (`calibrate_d_free`) is keyed on the exact per-frame CNR, which
simulation knows. This pipeline keys the correction on the CNR that `fft-cnr`
estimates from each frame, and that key sets three things at once: the
subtracted bias, the weight, and the floor cut. The combination is tested in
simulation in the fft-cnr paper (`../fft-cnr-paper`, case 27: Gaussian, Voigt,
and generalized-Gaussian p = 1.5 and p = 4 profiles, D 0.005 to 0.1, CNR_0 5 to
90, 300 runs per cell).

- **Where the per-frame key holds.** With the exact key, the corrected mean D
  is within 0.85 to 1.15 of the reference in every cell from CNR_0 5 to 8 at
  D = 0.02. With the estimated key, it holds only where every fitted frame stays
  well above the floor: from CNR_0 about 34 at D = 0.02 (about 55 for the
  heavy-tailed p = 1.5 profile, 13 for p = 4) and from CNR_0 about 21 at
  D >= 0.05. Below that, the pooled Gaussian mean at D = 0.02 over CNR_0 8 to 90
  is 1.9 (standard error 0.4).
- **Why.** Random key error of up to 0.2 of the CNR per frame is tolerated. The
  estimate is not random about the exact value near the floor: it reads 0.89 to
  0.97 of the exact CNR at CNR 1 to 2, scatters by 0.6 to 0.9 of the value below
  CNR 1, and reads about twice the exact value below CNR 0.5. Frames near the
  floor are therefore over-corrected, and frames below it are admitted and
  under-corrected. The key and the width also come from the same frame, and
  their errors are correlated (a frame whose CNR reads high has a width that
  reads low; correlation -0.1 to -0.3).
- **What does not fix it.** A stricter floor on the estimate (2 or 3)
  over-subtracts on every shape except p = 4, because the frames it keeps are
  the ones whose estimate reads high. Dropping frames whose CNR interval
  includes zero removes 0.31 to 0.45 of the frames at CNR 1 to 2, selectively,
  and still over-subtracts on the non-Gaussian profiles. A calibration keyed on
  the estimate transfers poorly between distributions of true CNR.
- **Cross-fitted key.** A cross-fitted key (frame t's CNR predicted from the
  other frames by a robust straight-line fit of log CNR against time) matches
  the exact key from CNR_0 13 on all four shapes. It adds a decay-trend model
  with its own assumptions, so it serves as a check of the cause, and the
  pipeline keys on the per-frame estimate.
- **On the measured scans the effect is small**: only 0.035 of the retained
  frames (18 included stroboSCAT scans) are below CNR 2.
- **fft-cnr version.** Use fft-cnr 0.3.3 or later, the first PyPI release
  that carries commit 69cd361 (0.3.2 is tagged but not published). Earlier
  versions return occasional runaway
  generalized-Gaussian fits on frames below CNR 1 (CNR of tens to thousands;
  about 0.015 of the frames below CNR 0.5); two of the 187 stroboSCAT scans pass
  the triage screen only with the fix, because a runaway frame makes their
  merged D negative. `pyproject.toml` requires `fft-cnr>=0.3.3`, and `uv.lock`
  pins the PyPI release with its hash.

## Data

Read-only from the pshare; see `DATASETS.md`. Raw collaborator scans stay on the
pshare (never committed). All *generated* outputs are tracked here under
`diagnostics/` (per-measurement folders, `_frame_ladder/`, `_calib/` calibration
caches, `index.md`, `METHOD.md`, `triage*.csv`).

## Run

```bash
# per-measurement diagnostics (builds + caches calibrations under diagnostics/_calib)
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/wse2-strobescat/realdata_diagnostics.py <name>
# Enrique-pipeline reproduction + correction, all registered measurements
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/wse2-strobescat/realdata_enrique_pipeline.py
# the CNR frame ladder and the simulated recovery demo
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/wse2-strobescat/realdata_frame_ladder.py

# the real-data panel
.venv/Scripts/python.exe experiments/wse2-strobescat/render_realdata_panel.py
```

`FOLDED_DEBIAS_WORKERS=1` (serial) is the safe default for the calibration
builds; `=0` (all cores) is faster but the Windows process pool can break under
CPU contention.

## Key result + figures

- Benefit (simulation): `diagnostics/_frame_ladder/0_simulated_benefit.png` and
  `0b_simulated_distribution.png` -- the true width recovered from frames that
  look unusable; the ensemble distribution recentered on truth.
- Limitation: `diagnostics/_frame_ladder/5_cnr00.5_*` -- below-floor
  over-subtraction.
- **Real-data panel: `realdata_panel_MoSSe-26_32.png`** (caption
  `realdata_panel_MoSSe-26_32_caption.md`) -- the correction on the clean
  **MoSSe alloy** `26_32/250716` (sample `250716_MoSSe_mystery`, **not WSe2**),
  de-parity merged, in physical um^2 (0.060 um per px). The panel fits the early
  diffusive window (t <= 2 ns): naive D 0.0116 -> corrected 0.0113 um^2/ns
  (ratio 0.97). The de-parity diagnostics over the retained range (tail cut at
  4.8 ns; `diagnostics/index.md`) give 1.480 -> 1.401 px^2/ns, that is
  0.0053 -> 0.0050 um^2/ns (ratio 0.95), with the change concentrated in the
  low-CNR late frames. Neither number has an SE, and neither is validated against
  an independent reference (see Key findings). Rendered by
  `render_realdata_panel.py`. The WSe2 `Power_var/250224/0.020` scan
  is not used: it is degenerate (negative D) under per-sweep re-zeroing.
- Per-measurement views: `diagnostics/<measurement>/msd_enrique_pipeline.png`,
  `msd_deparity.png`; summary in `diagnostics/index.md`. Reported in px^2 or
  um^2; the pixel is 0.060 um at the sample for every scan (Enrique Arévalo
  Rodríguez; `UM_PER_PX` in `realdata_diagnostics.py`). Do not take the scale
  from his `X(um)` array (it steps by 0.0036 = 0.060^2) or from the ratio of his
  fitted sigma (um) to our px fit (fit-dependent, 0.065 to 0.089 um/px). The
  unit-free ratio is the headline.
- Excluded scans: `WSe2/Power_var/250904_skong/5MHz/bad` (spot out of focus;
  Enrique advises not to use it) appears in `diagnostics/triage.csv` and
  `triage_deparity.csv` as a screened row only and must not be used. In
  `WSe2/test/mostly_tests/250603_2` the first delay (2.55 ns, acquired last,
  so the loaders make it a one-frame sweep of its own) is unusable; drop it
  before any fit. The triage rows for that scan include it.

## Depends on

`folded_debias` (`calibration`, `truncation`, `weights`, `cnr`, `fit`,
`noise`). `fft-cnr` for per-frame CNR. The diagnostic scripts share
`realdata_diagnostics.py` (local sibling).

fft-cnr note: the per-frame CNR must be measured on the spot window, not the full
line-cut (off-spot structure corrupts the spectral CNR at low signal) --
