# Caption: real-data panel (MoSSe alloy)

Material: **MoSSe alloy** (Mo(S,Se)2; Enrique Arevalo Rodriguez's stroboSCAT
sample `250716_MoSSe_mystery`, `mixed_tmdc/26_32/250716`). Not WSe2.

The truncation-bias correction on a real diffusion measurement, in physical
units. Each of the two interleaved delay sweeps is re-zeroed to its own t0
(de-parity), the merged MSD is converted to um^2 with the 0.060 um pixel at the
sample (0.0036 um^2/px^2, from Enrique Arevalo Rodriguez), and the per-frame
widths are averaged
in inverse-variance-weighted time bins over the early diffusive window
(t <= 2 ns). Points are the binned naive fitted sigma^2 (red, open) and the
corrected sigma^2 (blue, filled) at the same bin time; error bars carry the
within-bin scatter. Binning removes the per-frame scatter and the even/odd parity
wobble -- the systematic bias survives averaging, the noise does not -- so the
correction shows on every binned point.

Result: **naive D = 0.0116, corrected D = 0.0113 um^2/ns, ratio 0.97** -- the
correction lowers D by about 0.03 of its value on this measurement (over the
retained range to the 4.8 ns tail cut, the de-parity diagnostics give ratio
0.95; `diagnostics/index.md`). Fit over the 16 frames with per-frame CNR >= 1.3
and t <= 2 ns (t = -0.1..1.8 ns, CNR 2.5..18). Below-CNR-floor late frames (where
the correction over-subtracts -- the documented limitation) are excluded.

What this shows and what it does not: the corrected points sit below the naive
ones on every binned point by construction, because the subtracted bias is
positive and grows as CNR falls. No independent reference D exists for this
scan and no SE is computed for the ratio, so the panel shows what the correction
does, not that the corrected D is closer to the true D. The bias magnitude, and
its removal where the reference is known, are shown by the simulation recovery
demo (`diagnostics/_frame_ladder/0_simulated_benefit.png`,
`0b_simulated_distribution.png`).

The pixel scale is not taken from the ratio of Enrique's fitted sigma (um) to the
px fit: that ratio depends on the fit model and window and is not a calibration.
The ratio 0.97 does not depend on the scale.

Style: Spanish-flag palette (flag red = naive/biased, flag blue = corrected/
reference), transparent background. Rendered by `render_realdata_panel.py`.
