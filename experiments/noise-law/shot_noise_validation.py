"""Does the folded-normal correction hold across transport-microscopy noise laws?

The poster is not tied to one technique, so the correction must hold across the
noise regimes that different transport-microscopy methods present. Two bases,
anchored by real data on the pshare:

  WHITE / constant floor -- differential, pump-probe imaging (stroboSCAT,
    transient absorption). Measured on real stroboSCAT frames: the noise is set
    by a bright constant probe pedestal (~172 counts, noise ~1.4 counts), so it
    is effectively signal-independent; the signal's own shot is <~20% of the
    variance even at the brightest pixel. This is the law the calibration is
    built on.
  SHOT / Poisson -- photon-counting and direct emission imaging (time-correlated
    single-photon counting, PL imaging). Poisson by construction: variance =
    counts. Faithful low-count Poisson matters in the dim, low-CNR frames where
    the bias bites.

For each noise law this script asks the two questions an expert panel raised:

  CORRECTNESS -- with a calibration built under the SAME law, is the bias
    removed (as it is for white)?
  ROBUSTNESS  -- does the DEFAULT white-noise calibration, applied to data of
    another law, still de-bias D, or must the calibration be rebuilt?

Everything runs through the same audited calibrate/evaluate path (`validate.py`)
with only the noise law swapped (`folded_debias.noise`), so the comparison
isolates the noise model. The metric is mean(D_hat)/D_true for the folded-normal
scheme across an initial-CNR sweep; uncorrected OLS is the raw bias to remove.

Run from the repository root (serial by default; set FOLDED_DEBIAS_WORKERS to
parallelise)::

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/shot_noise_validation.py

Sweep sizes are set by the SHOT_* environment variables below (small defaults
for a quick serial smoke run; raise for the full run).
