"""Load the high-statistics Br-I halide-mixing maps (400k-walker average).

Marc Meléndez's original maps are histograms of only 20,000 walkers, so each
frame carries Poisson sampling noise that, read off the peak, sets an intrinsic
contrast-to-noise floor (~30) right inside the CNR range we want to test. To get
a clean ground-truth profile with no shape assumption, Marc's simulator was
re-run at high walker count and the independent instances averaged; see
``P:/jthiebes/WIP/BrI_halide_highN/README.md``. The 2-D averaged map was
collapsed to 1-D on the run machine (``collapsed_1d.x_<frac>.npz``: the
``prof_x``/``prof_y`` projections plus axes and metadata), so only the small npz
is read here -- never the multi-GB map.

Geometry: 600 bins over a 3000 nm window (5 nm/bin), 601 frames at 5 ps to 3.0
ns, initial 1-D sigma ~25 nm. The wide box leaves the spot well inside even the
fastest fraction (last-frame +/-7.6 sigma at x=0.25), so the binned moment is not
clipped -- unlike the legacy 150 nm maps in :mod:`br_data`.

The carrier (transport) truth is the particle second moment in
``variance.x_<frac>.avg.dat`` (the 2-D trace var_x + var_y, computed from the
walkers' unwrapped positions and so free of any binning or box truncation);
halving it gives the isotropic 1-D truth, the same convention as
:mod:`br_data`. The collapsed profiles' binned 1-D moment agrees with this to
~1% (a small Sheppard bin-width offset), confirming the projection.

Two modelling points the validation depends on (shared with :mod:`br_data`):

  * **Imposed decay.** The maps are per-frame normalised, so a real transient-PL
    measurement's decaying integral is absent. Each frame is multiplied by
    ``N0 * exp(-t/tau)`` to set the per-frame contrast-to-noise. Over the 3 ns
    window a 2D-perovskite lifetime (tau ~ 1 ns) decays ~20x, which -- together
    with the diffusive spreading -- drives the late-frame per-frame CNR down
    through ~1, the regime the correction is built for. (The legacy 0.1 ns
    window never reached it.)
  * **Clean truth.** With 400,000 walkers the map's own sampling noise is small
    (intrinsic peak CNR ~50 for this geometry), so the imposed measurement noise
    dominates across the CNR sweep up to ~50; above that the map's own noise
    starts to limit, which is why the sweep is capped there.
