"""Render the per-frame figure for the high-N Br-I bed, with its results table.

Three panels, one per Br fraction (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), at initial CNR 15,
the lowest initial CNR at which the corrected D does not depend on the
joint-lookup key (``key_sensitivity.py``). Each panel shows, per frame, the mean
fitted variance over the seeds minus the Gaussian fit of the noise-free profile,
for the naive fit and for the corrected fit, with standard errors. That residual
isolates the noise bias, which is what the correction removes. The separate
offset between the noise-free fit and the carrier reference (the shape and
emission-to-carrier gap, which no noise correction addresses) is drawn as its
own line.

The correction uses the dense joint (CNR, sigma^2) calibration and the
iterated measurement-level key (``iterated_key_correction``). The table
``br_halide_highn_perframe.txt`` gives the short-window D against the carrier
reference and against the noise-free fit, with standard errors from resampling
the seeds. It also scores two more corrected arms, the Fisher-anchored 1-D
calibration with a width table (``fisher_calibration``, same key), which
rescales one calibration to each frame's width instead of measuring every
width: the pre-specified arm calibrates at sigma_0, and a post hoc arm at the
width of the frames the correction acts on (``FISHER_LATE_SIGMA_NM``), added
after the sigma_0 arm over-subtracted. Each corrected D carries a calibration
SE as well: the spread of D over draws of its lookup's own Monte Carlo error,
which is shared by every measurement and so does not shrink with the seeds.
