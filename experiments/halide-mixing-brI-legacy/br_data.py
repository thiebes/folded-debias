"""Load Marc Melendez's Br-I halide-mixing diffusion maps (read-only from P:).

Source: a 2D-perovskite exciton-diffusion Monte Carlo on a halide-mixing energy
landscape (Br fraction x), the regime of "halide mixing inhibits exciton
transport in two-dimensional perovskites" (the folder's Biblio). Halide disorder
suppresses transport far below the clean-layer diffusivity (D0 ~ 0.02 um^2/ns):
the effective D is ~0.003 um^2/ns and the spreading is subdiffusive
(apparent alpha ~ 0.88), so this is a heterogeneous-transport stress test on a
material system distinct from the Mn maps and the disordered nanocrystal solids.

For each Br fraction Marc supplied (in ``BrI_x_<frac>/``):

  * ``diffmap.x_<frac>.dat`` -- 21 frames of 250x250 exciton-density maps, stacked
    as consecutive 250-row blocks, over 150x150 nm^2 (0.6 nm/bin), sampled every
    5 ps (tsamp = 0.005 ns) to tmax = 0.1 ns. Each frame is normalised to unit
    integral (the simulation tracks position only -- no recombination).
  * ``variance.x_<frac>.dat`` -- per frame, ``(time_ns, variance)``. The variance
    is the *particle* (carrier) second moment, summed over both axes
    (var_x + var_y). Transport is isotropic here (var_x = var_y to <1%), so the
    1-D carrier variance is half of it. This is the carrier-transport truth, and
    being particle-based it is free of the box-truncation that clips the binned
    map's own moment (below).

Two modelling points the validation depends on:

  * **Imposed decay.** The maps are per-frame normalised, so a real transient-PL
    measurement's decaying integral is absent. We multiply each frame by
    ``N0 * exp(-t/tau)`` to set the per-frame contrast-to-noise. Over the 0.1 ns
    window a 2D-perovskite lifetime (tau ~ 1 ns) decays only ~10%, so the CNR
    falloff is dominated by diffusive spreading (the unit-integral 1-D peak drops
    as 1/sqrt(variance)); the result is insensitive to the exact tau.
  * **Narrow box.** The profile reaches only ~+/-2.3 sigma of the +/-75 nm window
    by the last frame, so the binned second moment clips ~15% of the variance at
    late times and reads the apparent alpha / D_eff low. A bounded width fit
    extrapolates the tails and recovers the particle variance (the carrier
    truth); the moment estimator does not. That is why the truth here is the
    particle ``variance.dat``, not the map's own moment.
