# Rebuild the NC-solid Gaussian (CNR, sigma^2) calibration at high statistics.
#
# The poster figure's folded-normal correction reads var_bias from
# output/calibration_nc_solid_gaussian.npz, a Monte Carlo lookup on a
# (CNR, sigma^2) grid. The committed calibration is 1000 runs/cell, whose MC
# noise imprints a reproducible wiggle on the corrected-alpha series. This
# rebuild raises it to 8000 runs/cell (~2.8x less grid noise) and closes two
# coverage gaps (CNR 100 -> 250; sigma-max 0.28 -> 0.35). ~96M small fits.
#
# Run on a multi-core Linux machine (or WSL).
